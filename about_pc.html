		<h1>About PolitiCats!</h1>

		<br>Do you feel it necessary as a citizen in a democracy to spend time better understanding 
		your political beliefs? </br>

		<br>But wouldn't you also like to spend that time looking at pictures of cats?</br>

		<br>Now, you can do both!</br>

		<br>The Politicats Quiz is the only political quiz aimed specifically at cat lovers.</br>

		<p>This is a time of great uncertainty in the US; the economy is weak, the housing market is still 
		unstable, and the atmosphere in the Capital between Democrats and Republicans is rancorous. 
		This site is designed to help voters better understand their own political beliefs. Instead of 
		just toeing the party line, our application (with a little twist of humor) will give users the 
		opportunity to reexamine their position on the political spectrum. All while looking at cats.</p>

		<p>In the spirit of the up-coming elections, the Politicats Quiz maps your political beliefs onto two 
		axes (social and fiscal political scales) in order to help you visualize your political positions. 
		After finishing the quiz you will see how you compare to our collection of Politicats: cats representing
		various political leaders.</p> 
		
		<p><b>Disclaimer: The PolitiCats team would like to let our users know that, while we did try to match 
		our PolitiCats with the social and fiscal values of actual politicians, our process was not scientific.
		Sadly, we could not get direct access to Sarah Palin or her Caribou friends. and Chairman Mao's lips are
		now permanently sealed. Therefore, our application is more of a technology demonstration - the political 
		mappings are not 100% accurate.</b></p>
		
		<p>We hope you enjoy our meow-tastic quiz!</p>
